Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself
Beauty in things exists in the mind which contemplates them
because of your smile, you make life more beautiful
everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it 
i have never seen a smiling face that was not beautiful  
If the path be beautiful, let us not ask where it leads
It is just a bad day, not a bad life
thE best way to pay for a lovely moment is to enjoy it
The future belongs To those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
whenever you are creating beauty around you, you are restoring your own soul
